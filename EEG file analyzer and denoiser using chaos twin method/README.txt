To run the Python code, you need the following libraries:

numpy - For numerical and matrix computations.
mne - For processing EEG data.
matplotlib - For plotting graphs.
scipy - For scientific analysis and signal filtering.
To install these libraries, use the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy mne matplotlib scipy
How to Use the Python Code
Steps to Run the Code:
Download EEG Data
Ensure you have a valid EEG data file (e.g., from the CHB-MIT database). You can upload your EEG .edf file to the your-edf-file path in the code, or simply change the file_path variable to your file location.

Run the Code
Open the terminal and run the following Python command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python analyzer.py
Results

The code will plot both the original and filtered EEG signals.
The Chaos Twin points in the filtered EEG signal will be detected and shown as red points on the plot.
Code Explanation:
EEG Data Loading:
The code loads EEG data using the mne library. Make sure to set the file_path variable to the location of your EEG file.

Bandpass Filtering:
A bandpass filter (0.5-50 Hz) is applied to the EEG signal to remove noise.

Chaos Twin Detection:
The algorithm detects Chaos Twin points based on the rate of change in the EEG signal and visualizes them on the plot.
